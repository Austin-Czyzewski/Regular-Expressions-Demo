# Regular-Expressions-Demo
This is created to showcase a demonstration of regular expression use for practical applications.

In this repository there is a .txt file that I created with some stock information in it. This is filled with keyboard mashing and the purpose is to show that you can get rid of that keyboard mashing using regular expressions (regex).


Regex_demo.py was created to allow one to run this program without having a Jupyter installation
